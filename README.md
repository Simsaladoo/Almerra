Startup Launcher for Winds of Almerra

This tool acts as a Launcher for the Engine as well as to play the latest version of the game builds.  
Included is a tools menu which will be populated with useful actions for building various parts of 
the game, consisting of the BMP -> CSV database creator to convert map data into Fauna, Foliage and Sound locators.  Currently working with Type1s and Type2s for 550ft and 105ft respectively.
